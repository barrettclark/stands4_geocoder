## Stands4 Gem

Make a call to send a zipcode to the Stands4 reverse geocoder API

http://www.stands4.com/services/v1/zip.aspx

This was used as an example in a talk that I gave on consuming a resource and testing it in a ruby script. The code was then made into a gem to demonstrate how to do that and use it in the same project.

## Gem Creation

* bundle gem stands4_geocoder
* new .rvmrc and gemset (this is just how i roll)
* update the gemspec
* bundle install (to pull the gem dependencies and also any development dependencies)
* write the awesome code (or copy your awesome code into the new gem project)
* write (or copy over and update) your awesome tests
* rake install (will create a pkg directory and put the gem in there)
* gem push stands4_geocoder-0.0.1.gem

And now you can include the gem in your app
